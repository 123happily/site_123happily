For my own use:
(!) First, (!!) Second etc
(%) Worth an honorary mention as well

#### chill dudes (and dudettes) hangout (%)
Feeling the shoe about to drop and then seeing 'I loves the busssss!' is peak comedy
Docking one imaginary point for 'dudes' I don't think anyone says that maybe I'm not american enough or something though
point restored for 'so is purple lost or not?' peak clueless text
I'm having so much fun. Too much fun even, to be properly scared.
Unique metatextual corner to be stuck in- can't cut someone off mid-text cause then they'd never have sent it.
Purple kinda chill about Green being dead but that's ok we all react differently in times of crisis
Please I want the 'yo i'm here' horribly timed messages to never stop coming its so funny
i like Yellow
nearly choked on my water
I don't know if i can give it a high made-up score for the ending, but it's a super cool concept, and I'd love to read this with double the wordcount (but probably not more)

#### Hypnosferapy (!!!!)
I don't know what this server has with censoring words and then making that canon but I love it every time
Dude, this is so fucking cool on concept alone. You've fully sold it to me and we've barely started. Fantastic.
My mandatory whingy nitpick is that blood is warm fresh from a body (if that is what's happening here)
Yeah, 10/10. perfectly executed for the wordcount. I'm two entries in and already wonder if anything will top this.
It would have been funny to put an empty trigger warning at the start btw

#### The Warning (%)
Hitting a few snags (typo, a bit lackluster distinction around what's a thought and what's narration) off the jump, but that's not the end of the world
Girl, I don't care if that's a typical nightmare, you have to realise you're in a horror film and leave now while you can still get a decent price for the house girl
“The psych-ward needs new residents.” IS INSANE
hell of a 'I told you so'
I think the dialogue could be improved a bit, atm it feels too direct and expositional. But I really like the concept and the story wrapped up well in 1000 words!

#### The Breathing
A few more snags though they aren't something that might be immediately caught in an editing pass. What caught me was describing the fields as stretching on for miles two times in as many sentences, and 'what I believe even worse' which I think is missing an 'is' or it's just stylised in a way I don't get (very possible). Or this sentence (But now, even if it would prove true whatever is making that deep horrific breathing sound is just my imagination, I feel it was) I can't follow what it was meant to be.
So far the first entry to have a line with what I found was a really neat poetic turn of phrase, but I struggle to see much in terms of concept or plot here, which is fine. It was either aiming for a vibes-only execution or the meat of it sailed past my head entirely.

#### Return of White Buffalo Calf Woman (%)
Can I dock an imaginary point for a typo in the trigger warnings? I can because they're my imaginary points. Sorry.
I was really wrapped up in the vibes mix here, but 'all cases from poisoned farms' sort of took me out. I don't know if the narrator knows this, or Loreen knows this, and it felt like something that was obvious or maybe best left to reader interpretation. But I'll set that aside and keep going.
Immediately, the 'Once' in the next sentence hurts the read. It implies other stuff happens since then that isn't worth talking about, but we move into immediate consequences of the charge, so it's probably better off not being included. I'm horribly nitpicky, sorry
Another nitpick, even though I'm really enjoying this, 'finding a loved one with the sticky congealed blood on their scalp' i think 'the' here does more damage than good to the flow of the read. its just a bit incongruous IDK
This montage is really, really well executed. The whole story actually is really cool and a bit too wish-fulfilment to be a horror story (LMAO) I'd kiss that spirit lady if she showed up in my bedroom i need this to happen to corrupt ceos irl too bad

#### Steps
Ooh, hidden content warning. I like it.
Whoever you are, I love you, but 'Still, she had a bad feeling about being here. The building never felt friendly, but right now it felt downright hostile. Dangerous. Probably just the darkness, though. At least she’d get her steps in today.' is the most cliche horror paragraph I've read so far and I don't feel like that's the angle we're going for here so I'm taking away two whole imaginary points.
'She was in a concrete tower of steps.' also feels unneeded, though I see what you were trying to mean, just trust the reader to figure out that one, or maybe swap for 'it was always like this down here' if the intent was to say this isn't some paranormal anti-4G field
I kinda fuck heavy with this 'there's always a bigger fish' situation
OK I hate to say this but it's a sort of limp ending, it felt out of nowhere and seems to try for a comedic end but, I have no leads on who the man was or what the wire creature was about, so it all feels a bit coincidental and awkward as it stands. A solid attempt though, and some actually creative ideas regardless of execution.

#### Blue (%)
Page is blue. Already getting what I was promised. I like that.
The :3 spam is insane (/pos i guess??)
Nitpick time, consider '‘lone wolf’s' becoming ''lone wolves''.
Well you taught me a new word so 10/10
is 'dis-ease' a play on 'disease' or was it maybe better off as 'unease' I'll never know
'un-fucking-killing-herself—like a flesh accordion' gets the ficticious prize of Hardest Line So Far
3: made me laugh
Wait this is really funny. This is finally a combination of horror and comedy that doesn't make me cringe. Well played.
'UPDATE: We’ve done it!' Is this a fucking Patreon post? I'm going to actually lose it the tonal whiplash of this one is phenomenal in the best way. I expect this might have controversial reception but I love it.
So like... are the :3s expressions of seething rage? this is so funny man
Called it
What the fuck, dude, what the fuck. The record stands that after finishing this I've stuck it as my number 1 for now.
(update to the record: it was a tough competition but this is easily my fifth i'm so sorry)

#### The Color Black (%)
Not a black page :( Sorry, I've been spoilt by the last one.
something about the writing makes the bag of teeth feel really casual, i'm hooked immediately with that.
ok very severance
'back when you could simply buy houses' it's already got a stronger horror execution than some other whole entries /hj
Writing is super solid so far as well
bro found the house of the tooth fairy??? you have great descriptive writing and conceptual punch as well
Ok that's really cool, the sheer ambiguity of 'away from what he saw' sort of bothers me cause i dont have enough leads to really mull over what it could have been. the painting, i guess? or he got a glimpse of the man's face off camera? but really well done!

#### Somewhere, Someone (!!)
You win hardest opening line.
and hardest opening paragraph. fuck. what the fuck.
I don't understand exactly where the hole is and that scares me so 10/10 for horror
holy shit. i dont really know what,,, happened here,,, but you cooked. you cooked.
Actually how am i meant to choose a winner, or even a top four, fuck this, you're all too good

#### No, You Didn't (%)
oh yeah we have second person or whatever the fanfic mode is called
early title drop very well executed and deserves to be there well played
'a desperate hand in the water trying to drown you.' can't describe the noise i made at that, very nice
Very weird nitpick here but! It's about appallachian folk tales/legends but the phrase 'my pretties' is so painfully british that i'm docking an imaginary point for vibe incongrinuity
Ok. Ok it's really cool but it's falling into the same camp of 'you're somewhere, it's spooky, there's a monster, it gets you, story ends' that just doesn't do it for me. I might not be the right audience for that kind of horror, IDK. But aside from that this was pretty cool so I'll honorable mention it for sure

#### The Last Cradle (%)
Yeah dude. Fuck yeah. This whole thing went down in one go like ... I guess that's how people drink shots of whiskey or whatever alcohol goes in the little glasses. Anyway, this was really fucking cool from a vibes/sensation perspective. Just personally I'm a bit too lost on what might be going on - is it a rapture thing? - to really dig my teeth into it conceptually, but the writing style is smooth and intense. Many imaginary points to you.

#### It's Just Business (%)
I can barely read this but I think it's my dark mode extension (even though I turned it off.) Sorry if I'm stepping on some stylistic choice but I'm gonna have to read this via highlighting it
OK you might also have hardest opening line. Second place hardest opening line.
'I can certainly imagine what the consequences of a mistake would look like.' thats actually a really funny horror line
yay word censoring! I wasn't kidding when I said I liked it but I'm starting to worry I'll get sick of it. for now though. it is cool.
Also conceptually, this rocks so far. I haven't consumed much ghost hunting media so maybe I'm just unsullied by previous expectations or knowing the cliches, but this is cool!
Doing something so weird and saying 'its like frying an egg' is the most worldbuilding i've seen from a single line in a hot minute lol
yeah, gems makes sense. idk why i could predict gems but here we are
yeah, yeah yeah! really cool. I wouldn't say it's horror, quite, but it's cool!

#### Okefenokee
Another hidden TW with instructions! even better!
I like that this person is so dedicated to Lucy that the first thought is the trauma they might have caused her and not why the fuck is there a pile of child bodies under the blood house
Wait why does it lowkey feel like they *knew* what happened here to some degree.
OK, it's cool I think. I feel like the first half was wasted a bit- the monster (which I thought was maybe just a crocodile) not being mentioned again, it's lacking a sense of completeness. But it's not bad by any means, it's stronger on characterisation than the background average imo.

#### The Box (!)
'Eat everything in the fridge and then kill myself' hell yeah priorities
WHOAH what a turnaround
the box of logic and calm reasoning i fucking guess
dude............. i REALLY like this one. this didn't even feel like 1000 words (nice job nailing the wordcount btw)
I could try to elaborate on why it's good but then i'd just be describing your own story back to you. Really really good.

#### The Pirate
Ok I... don't know what to make of this. This felt like a drug trip. I don't know how much of the vibe mix was intended, but if it was 100% intended, I don't even know if I'm happy that it was? That sounds really negative, it's not meant to be. It's a horror competition, and I'm unsettled, but I don't think this did what it could have given the wordcount. Just a few too many questions and weird curveballs. The yars were really funny though.

#### Raptors (%)
I wanna see some dinosaurs
thanks for teaching me a new word
DICK HARD ON THE BUTT sorry sorry sorry
eeeeih 'Besides, there was no one within 40 miles for her to run to.' might be one of the scariest standalone lines though I don't think it was even meant to be
DINOSAUR!!!!!
'at forty-something employees' what was the submission limit for this comp again you clever fuck
oh fuck you! /pos
just... fuck, thats really cool. The middle section was just a big bluff fakeout for the rest of the story but it was just good enough to still warrant existing (and its possible you're such a genius that you made it lag behind the rest of the story in quality to drive home the idea of this person generating the story for an llm-equivalent slop farm)

#### Starskin (%)
I really like stories that drop some batshit insane concept initially and then refuse to elaborate and instead give you more slightly less insane concepts to really chew on. Cool intro.
Yeah dude, yeah yeah yeah. FUCK how am I meant to pick a top four this is bullshit. just great execution overall, its both an alien and mundane horror. just simple human error, nothing targeted or menacing. I like it a lot.

#### Kuvo's Teachings
I guess it's about time we got a cult story!
first day of the week isn't capitalised and the next one is + a few missing fullstops and odd spacings. It sounds nitpicky but it reminds me I'm reading something someone wrote and not just beaming information into my brain so I'll mention it and dock an imaginary point for not editing enough. Cause I'm petty.
'Kuvo was a small man, but strong, and that was scarier.' Scarier than what? Small men?
Ok look listen don't talk to me at the end of a story. I know the cult stuff that goes on, I get it, I was kind of hoping for something more on top of this. Maybe it's cause I don't think about cults on the daily like I do the housing crisis or misogyny (i guess) but it just didn't land for me. Also, the writer is telling us this from his perspective but then it's 'this fiction'? No mention of him ever leaving the cult because of this mindset either. His shift into following them didn't quite track, the cult leader never struck me as particularly charismatic or manipulative (honestly he kind of sounded like your average preacher, keeping in mind I've only been to church like once against my will). I think a better approach to the same idea would be to pull on an existing cult horror story and twist it with something genuinely new to naturally invoke this fear about human compulsions/nature instead of telling me to be scared. It's definitely doable, and I like that you see such a potential in the idea.

#### The Space Between Worlds
'Aboard the Orbital Research Space Station, named however creatively by who used to be my superiors, shot so far from Earth by the bureaucrats back home who believed its contents, should an accident happen, could never see the light of day in the public’s eyes.' should be 'it could never see'. My nitpickiness does not abate with tiredness it seems.
'transfers my curated code flawlessly into the organism I’ve obscured the window to with my bedroom curtain.' is also awkward, there's no harm in making this two sentences or refactoring it entirely cause it doesn't quite make sense.
'It was always nicer sleeping to the view of the infinite space beyond me than the dry, white linen mere inches beyond my face.' also doesn't read quite right. is it 'rather than'? I still can't quite work it out. Do you do much viewing of things in your sleep? Like I follow what you mean but it takes me out of the story quite a bit.
hey it's immediately taken a really cool turn though after that rough patch.
'no reason' might read better as 'no need' or better 'no more need'. Just needs some clarity editing overall imo.
'already prepared' is a bit redundant when 'prepared' would do fine, but I'm only biting on this because i've been put in that mood by the work so far ^^;
'of which it had over ten of' I feel like this person who is so proud and hand-coded the DNA would know the answer to this
Oh, so it's not handcrafted DNA. my bad. point kind of still stands though there's no harm in putting down a number.
Really cool bitter rant about society actually.
Another thing to watch out for is the mixing of past and present tense, just to be a bit more careful with the usage, it's almost there but it's wacky enough to pull me out of the story.
unironic i'm jeff in the year of our lord? lmao
another weird note, i don't know if contractions like shouldn't've are usually used in writing (i.e shouldn't have instead), since this is the second one I couldn't help but mention it.
Another genuinely really good societal rant! seriously.
OK you know what despite all the micro textual stuff this concept is actually really intriguing and I like how deluded this person is.

#### 12 Cedar Lane (%)
This is really cute and sentimental and I'm dead?? I'm dead. Killer opener even if it isn't some explosive one liner.
FUCK kathy bro
oh naw FUCK KATHY
the she/her for the house does awesome lifting for the double meaning read of that one paragraph
FUCK kathy is a beige bitch of COURSE she is fuck kathy!!!
The writing, the rhythm, the unique voice, I love this so much.
I could have mentioned this the first time 'inhale, exhale' came up but i can't stop reading it as inexhahalele because of a stupid inside joke. I'm doing my best to lock back in lmao
OK my sister came home and i got distracted so if you want cope that I didn't like the story as much as I should that's it.
YEAH, this is really cool. I guess I'm bummed that the voice moved away from adressing us as 'you' to just describing things in standard narrator tone, cause that was cool, but I can see how that happened.
House gets revenge for being painted beige by a twat. Success story more than horror imo. good though.

#### The Natural Course
This intro paragraph does a great job of gently lowering me into the story, I like it a lot.
'It, seems to rise up' goodbye imaginary point, please draft your stories more my friends, IDK if i'm just more susceptible to being taken out of a work by these little errors than the average person but to use crude language it shits me quite a bit
I'm gonna headcanon this as the same Adam as the other story
this whole thing about the aspens being one tree is like, real, isn't it. I mean it's a thing that happens. Really cool how it sounds so horrifying introduced in this context.
'“Hah - who knows, maybe over the long course of its life it’s figured out a way to mind-control would-be animal threats like us with special pheromones or something. Hah!”' saying this with love- if this turns out to be the actual bit of the story I'm killing you with hammers for letting a neat idea slip loosely through the lips of Some Guy for a weak bit. That's a threat
ok so that seems to be the bit, what a bummer
otherwise, its a cool idea, i like that it doesn't need to resolve in someone dying at the end. I feel like I learned a bit about Adam but not quite enough- and maybe not much about anyone else either. Maybe I'm just in a bad mood, I feel like I've been overly cruel here.
I'm definitely in a bad mood since I got interrupted. You, too, can blame my sister's untimely arrival for this absolute ribbing I gave you when you didn't deserve it ;-;

#### Depths of Despair
Dude I'm in a bad mood so I'm sorry but you can't open with an editing issue like 'the cool, metal'. Minus two whole imaginary points.
Look... I have thoughts about some micro to improve the read of this a lot, but I'm clearly in too bad of a mood to serve them up in a constructive or nice way, so just... if you want me to do an editing pass on this, you let me know and I'll do it another day. Seriously.
'Heeuu-hee' am I being stalked by michael jackson? am *I* michael jackson? ... hell yeah
OK yeah I don't hate it. It's not bad, not at all. This might be a standalone in this comp where the protagonist seemingly knew what was coming and accepted their fate with it in this particular way, if I'm reading it right. But I do feel like I'm missing some substance or lore to make this a fully rounded meal.

#### Down Beneath the Stone (!!!)
For a moment I thought this was going to be some broad worldbuilding-esque truth about the fear of the dark but it's gotten more specific and I'm OK with that
This is really cool, actually. I'm so sleepy I don't have much more to say other than that I didn't find any issue with this, it maybe just wasn't 'my style' enough to put it in my top 4 ranking. Though it's close. Eh, I changed my mind, it goes in.
