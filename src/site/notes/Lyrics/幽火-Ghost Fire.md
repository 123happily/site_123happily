Multiple readings of 'Even if it's fake':

You picked flowers for me, even though *I'm a fake*
You picked flowers for me. *Even if you're fake...*
You picked flowers for me, even though *they were fake*
Even if you're a fake who picked flowers for me

I think the first two are most likely.

---

My interpretation of this story is as follows:

There's a village with a silver mine looking to make a profit. They bring a young boy in with them and encounter a spirit, the spirit of the mine (This spirit is the singer of the song if that wasn't clear from the first line). The townsfolk panic and decide to sacrifice the young boy, even though the spirit seems to have left them alone for the meantime (it won't find us, we'll be ok > someone shakes their head and says 'it's for everyone's sake'). The spirit decides to go instead of the boy. They push the spirit into the mine (probably, or just off a cliff or something) and the boy jumps after him. The spirit is a ghost that can't interact with the real world, hence why the young boy was picking flowers for it. So the spirit can't catch him (I assume that was the plan given the spirit has wings, but I'm confused as to why the townsfolk thought they'd achieve anything by pushing it off the cliff). Instead, the spirit decides that the boy is better off as a spirit as well instead of dead. Either the young boy dies at the bottom of the mine and becomes a spirit, or this transformation happens in mid-air- regardless, he can now grab the spirit's hand because he's a spirit as well. That's the only reading I could think of that matched everything, but I'm sure there are other interpretations out there.

A huge thank you to Archeia and JuriTea_ for the theory in the comments of the source Youtube video which helped point me in the right direction. Their interpretation of it is really interesting and equally likely, to be honest.
