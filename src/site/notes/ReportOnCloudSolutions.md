There are two main options suitable for MCB when it comes to a cloud storage solution.

Microsoft365, which you are all familiar with, and Google Drive. Functionally they do the same thing, but the differences in design philosophy are immense (and design philosophy was a root cause in the issue we've just experienced). I've tried to outline the pros and cons of each here, but I have a bias (that's probably quite obvious), so I found an online article that doesn't have glaring errors or fullscreen pop-ups as a second opinion:

And a reddit thread from people in a somewhat comparable situation for good measure:

## M365/OneDrive/SharePoint

**M365/OneDrive/Sharepoint Pros**
- Familiar to you all already, very little effort to re-establish.
- 1TB of free storage is more than enough for the band's needs.
- Includes web (and mobile) licenses for the Office Suite i.e Word, Excel, PowerPoint. Notably no longer supports the desktop versions of the apps, meaning you will only be able to access these via a browser.

**M365/OneDrive/Sharepoint Cons**
- OneDrive as a frontend is unreliable, invasive, and obfuscates how it actually works to the end user. It sits 'on top' of existing folders and removes files from computers to exclusively store them in the cloud by default (and sometimes even when you tell 'no'). It's widely disliked in the IT community, I asked some of my techy friends for their thoughts and have added them as a footnote.
- Complicated system. Microsoft's software suite is incredibly detailed, counterintuitive, and tangled. Combined with poor communication to its users, it increases the risk of incidents like the one that just occured.
- Microsoft is fond of changing their policies frequently and don't stick to their own promises, making them a risky choice to rely on in my opinion. This current issue was partly brought about due to a policy change.

## Google Drive

**Google Drive Pros**
- 100TB of free storage- just about 100x more than the band needs.
- It's simple. This is the biggest benefit in my opinion. Google Drive is just one, isolated folder location. It's much clearer where the files are being stored: whether they're online, on the local disk, or both. It's not intrusive either, the end user has full control over what it does.
- Google has managed to keep their systems mostly untangled and straightforwards compared to Microsoft, which makes it easier for me to use them and fix problems.
- Domain-name email addresses. If MCB was interested in migrating away from the current email solution, this would be a good replacement to consider.
- They also offer a Microsoft Teams equivalent for video conferencing and chats.
- Unrelated to the non-profit plan, Google offers a ridiculous amount of software for free for building websites, writing documents, taking surveys, uploading and sharing videos (YouTube), accessing satellite data (Google Earth), and even running intensive code on their GPU farms. In this regard, their attitude is generous as opposed to Microsoft's restrictive approach.
- From what I could find, in the case of a plan ending, Google keeps your data for 2 years before deletion, allowing you to reactivate the plan to regain access.

**Google Drive Cons**
- Migrating the storage to Google Drive does not mean losing access to Microsoft's software suite (i.e Word, Excel), but the mismatch might impact the ease of use depending on the individual. Word files would be stored in Google Drive and downloaded to be opened with Word (or Google Docs) on the receiving end (as opposed to opening directly from Sharepoint to a new tab of your browser, so it adds one extra step).
- Transitionary work and new learning. I'll do my best to make it as seamless as possible and I'm always available to help, but it will require some adjustment.
- Google uses AI to scan uploaded content for dangerous or illegal material, and I've heard talk of it overreacting to innocuous photos, particularly of children, resulting in the account being banned. I'm not sure how severe or common this issue actually is, nothing I found online seemed particularly applicable to the band's usage, but it's something to keep in mind.

In either case, I'll be setting up a hard backup inside the band hall. That will basically 'mirror' any content stored in the cloud to a physical drive so that in the event of a failure on Google or Microsoft's end, we retain an updated copy. Conversely if the drive itself experiences issues, the storage on the cloud will remain. The chance of both systems failing simultaneously is quite low, and each is easily restored from the other; this is standard practice for important data. For now I'm using a USB HDD I have lying around, but in the interest of longevity and secure storage I recommend upgrading to an SSD in future (~$200). The Library PC might already have one, that's something I need to check. 

Regardless of whether the band is interested in Google as a storage solution, I intend to maintain the Microsoft 365 plan to allow continued access to the Office suite (Word, Excel etc) for as long as it's still valued by the band. Though, it's worth noting that Word and Excel documents can be opened, edited, and saved using Google's alternatives.

Also since I'm new here I should say, I'm really excited to be invited in to such a fun and varied community! I left my chops behind in highschool so I'm glad there's at least something I can help with. I should have done more due diligence when I got onboarded to understand the systems better and to avoid this recent issue, and I'm genuinely sorry for all of the trouble. I'll do my best from here on out; I'm so grateful for the opportunity to put my skills into practice and get really valuable experience.

*Footnote about OneDrive from my tech friends, collected in the span of about 2 minutes*

"Onedrive tends to be much slower than google drive in my experience, the same size file takes like 1.5X as long from one drive, plus, there is the issue with windows kinda forcing it down your throat and causing windows computers to have issues due to it"

"my roomate lost her ENTIRE project files, literally ALL of them from her computer right before it was due. Onedrive can go to hell"

"It's shit"

"Definitely agree google is far less intrusive"
